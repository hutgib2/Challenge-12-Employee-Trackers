# Challenge 12: Employee Tracker

## Description

This Project is for tracking employees in order to organize and plan your business. It allows you to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in your company so that you can organize your business. I have  built an application using node inquirer and MySQL which allows you to navigate an employee database. This will allow non-developers to easily manage and interact with this employee info.

## Installation

The application uses MySql, inquirer, and node. To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

```
node index.js
```
